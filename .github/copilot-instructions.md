- Use **pnpm** only; never npm or yarn.
- Store all server code in `src/server` following the file pattern:
  1. `actions.ts` (handles requests)
  2. then `service.ts` (business logic, usesÂ `withAuth.ts`, instantiated via `serviceWrapper.ts`)
  3. then `repository.ts` (direct DB calls with Drizzle)

- **Never** use API route handlers; call server code via `actions.ts` only.
- Define types from schema as:

  ```ts
  type TableName = typeof tableName.$inferSelect;
  ```

- Write Drizzle queries with `db.query` and select only needed columns.
- In client components, fetch via TanStack Query, invoking `actions.ts` methods exclusively.
- For modals, co-locate trigger (button/action-icon) with the modal component to avoid prop drilling.
- Place new components alongside their parent unless shared; shared components go in `src/app/components`.
- Use the latest Mantine for responsive, mobile-friendly, minimal, professional UIs. Stick to predefined colors (`c="colorName"`), support light/dark themes.
- Never add comments in generated code.
- Avoid the `any` type completely.
